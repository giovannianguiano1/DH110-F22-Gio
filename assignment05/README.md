# Assignment 6: Low-Fidelity Prototype

## Description of Project
* My project is based on the WWF Together app, an app that allows users to explore and gather information about biodversity conservation. My goal is to redesign the app to allow users to go beyond just learning and gathering infromation and enable them to find volunteer and networking opportunities as well as share that information with their social networks with ease.
* What I have researched so far:

  * Based on my heuristics evaluation, I found that the app had amazing design aesthetic, but confusing nagivation. It was so complicated to get to each page and the functions weren't intuitive. You had to do lots of swiping, both up and down and side to side. Some features that were noted in the app's description weren't even present. In my usability testing, it was confirmed that the navigation was indeed complicated for users. My participant took a long time to complete each task and audibly expressed their frustration and confusion. In my user research and contextual interview, I found that users don't want to read lots of information and want quick access to what they're looking for. They also would prefer to see things that appeal to a more emotional standpoint rather than logical and straightfoward. Additionally, users want to be motivated to be involved and want those motivational resources to be easy to navigate. Users most difficult challenge seems to be how and where to get involved.

* 3 Personas

  From the above findings, I created two personas: 
  * Jordan Green, a Poltical Science major with a newfound interest in biodiversity conservation and an eagerness to meet likeminded peers.
  * Aileen Woodley, a vocal environemntalist who has just moved to a new city and looking to find new community and share things with friends and family.
  
  Find these personas [here](https://github.com/giovannianguiano1/DH110-F22-Gio/tree/main/assignment04) 
  
* 3 Features

  Based on the personas, I came up with 3 features they could find useful:
  * Filter function: Give users filter options that allows them to curate what they're looking for based on location, event-type, oganization-type, and
  time. This allows users to narrow down their choices and maximize their time.
  * Volunteer and Networking Opportunities tab: Many users express struggling with finding volunteer and networking opportunites on the internet or in
  person. They aren't quite sure where to look or who to ask. With this feature, users can find that all in one place with links that redirect them to the
  opportunities.
  * Sharing Function: Gives users the option to sahre anything they see within the app, whether it be wildlife information, a news article, a volunteer
  opportunity, or even a picture. Users are given multiple methods of sharing, such as messages, email, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat.
* Purpose of Low-fidelity Prototype
  * The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to translate the abstract concepts I have for these features into tangible mock-ups that will allow me
  to test their functionality. Through this, I can delve into the iterative and cyclical process of user research to invesitgate the discovery and
  evaluiation of my tentative feature and make the necessary revisions to ultimately improve user satisfation and ease of use before entering the high
  fiedlity prototype stage.


## Three tasks this prototype will support
1. Find a networking opportunity nearby using the advanced filter and plan to attend to an event
2. Go to the photos section and share a photo of an animal to a friend
3. Do a quick search about elephants and find a cause supporting them to donate to

## Reflection
*RECAP*
* What went smoothly: 

  * Task 1: The participant was able to successfully finds a networking opportunity utulizing the filter function and plans attendance
  * Task 2: The participant was able to successfully share a photo to a friend through messages very quickly
  * Task 3: The participant was able to successfully do a quick search about elephants using the search bar and navigate to their page to find causes to donate to and make a one-time donation
 
* What went wrong: 

  * Task 1: The participant gets stuck and questioned if they followed the correct order of the screens and comments that two screens are very simialr to
  each other. They end up skipping an entire screen.
  * Task 2: No errors or issues arose during this task, fortunately
  * Task 3: The participant followed a different order than the intended wireflow, skipping an entire screen. They did not question it like in the first
  task.

After establishing which features I wanted to test and the tasks that go along with it, I tried my best to imagine what would be simplest for the users to navigate through before I even started sketching my wireframes. The app I’m focusing on has really complicated navigation so I wanted to strip it down and make things more intuitive for users. Once I started drawing, however, I started feeling conflicted about what would look best and where, but then I had to remember that I was testing for functionality and not aesthetic. Once I got over that, I started to make better progress. I found the sketching to be quite enjoyable. The only thing that was bothersome was having to write very small and straight. My handwriting is typically very slanted and my lettering groups together so I tried my best to make it clear for everyone to read. One thing that I did not place a lot of focus on was the placement of my screens, which I feel is the reason why I had the issues I did. Some screens that were part of the same task were right next to each other. In the third task, my participant skipped over an entire screen and went to the one right next to it (i.e., participant went from 1 to 3 instead of 1 to 2 to 3). The participant gave quick feedback/commentary after the testing session and said they realized they skipped over it without realizing and that it made more sense for it to be in that order (the intended order). Perhaps if I hadn’t placed that one there, then my participant would have looked a bit closer to other screens. Additionally, my participant questioned whether or not they were doing the first task correctly at one point, but they noted it was because my two screens looked awfully similar. I agree that the two screens were very similar and understand how that lead to confusion. The only difference between them was the revealing of a drop down menu. I feel as thought had I made my titles more clear, my participant wouldn’t have run into that issue. Prior to the start of the testing session, my participant was instructed to talk aloud and also give commentary on what they see. They were great at talking aloud, but didn’t offer a lot of commentary. When I questioned this after the session, they told me they didn’t have much to say on it because everything seemed “like common sense” and the written function descriptions were “easy to understand.” I would take this comment as the design being intuitive for the user, which is a good thing! I wanted to include more screens for every part of each tab/widget, but did not want to add things that weren’t relevant for the users tasks (e.g., a screen that illustrated the calendar for the time-based filter). In the future, I want to test it out anyway.
