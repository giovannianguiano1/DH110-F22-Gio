### Purpose of UT + How and What I Test

In a usability test, usability is what is being measured. Usability refers to a quality attribute that measures how easily usable a user interface is, based on effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. The purpose of usability testing is to discover the most optimal avenue of a product’s usability. In other words, the aim is to find the best way to make a product more usable. When businesses and/or developers do usability tests, they are getting ahead of the curve of success in a sense. They are able to identify problems in the design of the product or service and can begin outlining opportunities and actions to improve upon them. Additionally, the process allows for them to learn more about the behavior and preferences of the users. For my app, WWF Together, there are large issues with simple navigation and lack of clear affordances and signifiers within the design. The integrated features are not intuitive to users making it difficult and frustrating for them to find what they want quickly and efficiently. As such, each of my tasks engaged either the aesthetic and minimalist design, recognition rather than recall, and/or user control and freedom heuristics. The tasks strategically required users to navigate back and forth throughout each page to observe their potential discovery (or possible miss) of the features within the app. Two out of three of the tasks were set up in a way that was not in an ascending order of the app’s design. For instance, the first task was simple in its navigation per the design of the app. Users would open up the start page then navigate to the specific page and swipe to find the information then exit. All of these actions appear in an orderly fashion. The other two tasks required users to navigate to the middle of the page or end of the page first then back to the start to maximize the range of usability for observation.

### Overall Experience of Pilot UT

What I learned from this pilot test is that my initial evaluation of the WWF app aligned with the experience of my participant. I described the app to be complex and confusing in its navigation due to its unintuitive and hidden features. The set up of the entire interview went well. There were no issues in reciting the prompt to the participant and everything felt clear. At first, there were connectivity issues with the devices being used but that was quickly corrected. During the moderating process, I tried my best to follow the example the professor gave during our activity together. I did my best to remain neutral and remind the participant to voice their thoughts and actions as they use the app. When my participant appeared to feel as if though they exhausted their options to complete the task, I would remind them of what they told me prior in how they navigate the app as a way to nudge them just like the professor did for me during our activity. I am unsure if I did everything perfect as a moderator, though. Throughout the process, I kept wondering if I should speak more, but I just pivoted to my experience with the professor and how she ran it with me and mimicked her. I do believe I could have been warmer, so in the future I will want to work on the warmth of my tone while still trying to remain neutral.
