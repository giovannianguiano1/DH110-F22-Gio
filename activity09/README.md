# The World Around You

### Design Statement

Although the environment can continue to survive in its natural state, human intervention has caused extensive destruction in many ecosystems. It is very important for us to protect our environment, so that we can continue to live on this planet - in a healthy and safe atmosphere. Healthy ecosystems clean our water, purify our air, maintain our soil, regulate the climate, recycle nutrients and provide us with food. They provide raw materials and resources for medicines and other purposes. They are at the foundation of all civilisation and sustain our economies.

### Research 

A heuristic evaluation was conducted on the WWF Togther with one user to have a more clear understanding of the existing UX-related issues with the app. The evaluaiton demonstrated that the navigation was very complex and unintuitive for users making them frustrated, so it did poorly in "Recogniton rather than recall". Find the full evaluation [here](https://github.com/giovannianguiano1/DH110-F22-Gio/blob/main/assignment01/README.md). I also conducted a pilot usability testing where it was found that much of the interface lacked clear affordances and signifiers, making it harder for users to perform their tasks. Next, a contextual inquiry was conducted to understand what features users were seeking and what would make it easier for them to use the app. I found that users were looking for more opportunites to get involved in biodiversity conservation. They did not just want to learn, they wanted to take action.
