# Sustainable Cities and Communities

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Giovanni Anguiano | DH110 | Fall 2022

### About the project

Although the environment can continue to survive in its natural state, human intervention has caused extensive destruction in many ecosystems. It is very important for us to protect our environment, so that we can continue to live on this planet - in a healthy and safe atmosphere. Healthy ecosystems clean our water, purify our air, maintain our soil, regulate the climate, recycle nutrients and provide us with food. They provide raw materials and resources for medicines and other purposes. They are at the foundation of all civilisation and sustain our economies. Currently, there our hundreds of apps focused on protecting biodiversity. This project will focus on two apps: Our Malibu Beaches and WWF Together.

### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) Explained

| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Users should always be informed about what is going on and should be given appropriate feedback to their actions |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Use concepts and language that are familiar and logical to the user |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Allow users to make mistakes; give them options to undo and redo tasks |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | Follow conventions and make sure design is consistent across the platform |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Get rid of error-prone conditions and provide users with safety nets for high-cost errors |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Minimize user's memory load by giving them suggestions and help in context |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Provide multiple ways to perform a task to make the platform accessible to all users |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Provide only relevant content and features |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | Tell users what the problem is and provide suggestions to fix it |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Supply users with extra help to complete their tasks |


### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group

The following rating scale can be used to evaluate the severity of usability issues:
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

Ratings are displayed in parentheses after each usability issue.

### About
[Our Malibu Beaches](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/our-malibu-beaches/id565636167) is an app asscociated with the Know What network, a collection of apps that inform people about different the locations around them. Our Malibu Beaches gives users pinpointed directions and tips to access Malibu beaches. Serving as an "owner's manual," users can find information about elusive accessways, parking information, signage information, as well as tide information. What's more, if users have a bad experience with accessing a beach, the app gives instructs on how to report it to the CA Coastal Commission. Additionally, users can learn more about the beaches they're visiting through a facts page. 

The app is full of useful information and interactive features that can be both helpful and confusing. My aim in this evaluation is to preserve the basic foundation while enhancing easier-navigation for the users.

### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* When users launch the app, they are greeted with an interactive map with little sun icons at particular locations that indicate an exisitng public beach. In the top right corner, they'll find a trigram, or "hamburger" symbol that serves as a nagivation menu where they can find a list of beaches with all the necessary information plus more. However, there is no search bar for easy access to a specific beach a user may be inquiring about. Instead, they must sift through the list(s) to find the beach they're looking for.

> *Recommendation: Include a search bar at the top center of the map that will either immediately locate it on the map for the user so they can tap on it's designated icon and be redirected to its information page or display a drop down tab for them to press and be redirected to its information page. Additionally, it would be good to have results displayed as the user types for even quicker access. This would encourage the user to explore the app more as well.*

##### Severity rating: 2
