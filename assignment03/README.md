# Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry (CI)

Giovanni Anguiano | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Introduction

## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge

This project is meant to support users in finding ways to engage with and get involved in wildlife conservation, with endangered species as the main focal point. With this project, I hope to understand what entices younger populations to be involved in wildlife conservation and environmental justice overall. This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for gathering and obtaining information in order to create impact within their community. The current existing solutions to satisfying the needs for getting involved in wildlife conservation may vary. Users may take the traditional route of finding and contacting an organization centered on wildlife conservation to learn more or volunteer. This orgniazation can be anything similar to a nonprofit organization or even a wildlife sanctuary. Both may provide users with information about endangered species and ways they can get involved. The current limitations in getting involved in wildlife conservation via seeking out an organization in person are difficulty finding them as well as finding one that fits what users are specifically looking for, transportation issues, sifting through pamphlets/leaflets to find information or sitting in a meeting. Users may tend to rely on finding organizations through word-of-mouth, through friends and family, or through posters/flyers which may make it difficult for them to find what they're really interested or want to support. Some users may lack the necessary transportation to get to the location of the organization so they're stuck where they are. Other users may have that transportation, but may then feel overhwhelmed with having to read through informational pamphlets/leaflets and sit through meetings to find the information they're looking for. Digital technology can alleviate these stressors by allowing users to quickly find streamlined information in one place from the comfort of their own space. 

## Step02: Target users 

The target users for this project are adults, between the ages of 25-35, that are interested in wildlife conservation and envrionmental justice. The average user should have some knowledge about wildlife conservation and biodiversity, but does not necessarily have to be an expert. These users would be seeking out information for their own personal, career, or academic endeavors, such as working on their own project about wildlife conservation or for a company, organization, or university. To complete their search, they may contact non-profits geared toward wildlife conservation, research a library's database, or reference different sites containing information about wildlife conservation. Their search would likely occur out in the field (e.g., visting organzation's offices or attedning events), or a personal or public space such as an office or library. To search for information online using a database or search engine would addtionally require internet connection.


## Step03: Research methods 
The observation method I selected was participatory observation. I had several activities with my interviewee to explore the issue and their potential interest as well as their reactions to the topic. The interview will be conducted at UCLA in the Student Activities Center using an audio recorder. The session will last less than an hour. The user will not be required to have any device, it will be provided for them. Prior to the interview, the user requested that their face not be included in the session, which was a constraint. Additionally, the screenrecording software that was going to be used kept failing during testing so it could not be included.

## Insights from the Interview 

* How interested are you in engaging with organizations online through educational material versus in person activism?
>* I'd say like, prefer, like, in person activism, just because, like, you know, it's face to face and you see, you know, the impact but like, you know, we're getting in like, these days, this day and age, like, everything's online. So like, I think we're just gonna have to like, you know, move with the times. And yeah, Then like obviously you can like reach like farther with like internet you know you can reach farther like to more people so like it's always something to like I guess become savvy in

* What are your thoughts about these definitions, these findings, and these figures that you’re seeing?
>* I think the the verbiage, the words are, like digestible enough that like, you know, like, somebody that didn't study what I did, can still, like, understand what is being talked about? Yeah, I think like, some of the articles were maybe like, a little too long, where it's like, if you're not interested in the topic, then like, it would, it's gonna be like, you know, I don't know if somebody would like, actually read through all of it

* Does reading more about these stories affect how connected you feel to the issue?
>* I wouldn't say reading about the stories, I think like, at least for me, videos are like, a lot more effective and like doing that. So like, you know, the readings, reading about it kind of like, you know, didn't really do a lot. But like those videos, especially like the second one, like, I don't know, it had definitely more of a lasting impact on me.

* Do you feel as though your age may be a barrier or asset to approaching these issues?
>* I would say like, personally, I would see like, I don't know, I feel like I don't have a lot of time to, like, volunteer or like help out and I think that's because of like, my age and like, how am I not-, I'm not like, you know, as maybe stable as like someone, like a little older than me would be like in their life. But I do feel as though like youth is important. You know, it brings like, you know, a new perspective to things. 

## Reflection 

My participatory observation session was really insightful and I really enjoyed learning more about what a typical person’s interest in the environment could be. There were thoughts and ideas that I had never thought of myself, such as consistent interaction with negative news and facts and how that impacts users motivation. This tells me that there should be a good balance of good and bad news where users understand the severity but don't feel hopeless and feel like abandoning their involvement. I had difficulty coming up with questions for my project, but when referring to some examples, I found and tweaked questions that I believed hit on what I was trying to invesigate while also being more general as the professor asked. The big goal for my project is to have users quickly find information and giving them apparent opportunites for involvement so a lot of my questions focused on how they find information and their motivations for involvement. Intially, I thought that more information and figures would be effective in raising motivation and interest, but through this interview, I found out that users seem to prefer quick information that can be easily digested (such as infographics) and that informational videos that appeal to emotions are more impactful for environmental justice. Next time, I will make sure the screen recording software is working properly and I will hopefully get the chance to record the user's face to capture reactions. I also want to be more mindful about how I phrase things. I didn't remain neutral in my statements at all times and that's something I should strive to do as to not create any pressure on the user to respond in a biased way.
