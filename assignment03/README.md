# Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry (CI)

Giovanni Anguiano | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Introduction

## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge

This project is meant to support users in finding ways to engage with and get involved in wildlife conservation, with endangered species as the main focal point. With this project, I hope to understand what entices younger populations to be involved in wildlife conservation and environmental justice overall. This activity fulfills the userâ€™s basic need for gathering and obtaining information in order to create impact within their community. The current existing solutions to satisfying the needs for getting involved in wildlife conservation may vary. Users may take the traditional route of finding and contacting an organization centered on wildlife conservation to learn more or volunteer. This orgniazation can be anything similar to a nonprofit organization or even a wildlife sanctuary. Both may provide users with information about endangered species and ways they can get involved. The current limitations in getting involved in wildlife conservation via seeking out an organization in person are difficulty finding them as well as finding one that fits what users are specifically looking for, transportation issues, sifting through pamphlets/leaflets to find information or sitting in a meeting. Users may tend to rely on finding organizations through word-of-mouth, through friends and family, or through posters/flyers which may make it difficult for them to find what they're really interested or want to support. Some users may lack the necessary transportation to get to the location of the organization so they're stuck where they are. Other users may have that transportation, but may then feel overhwhelmed with having to read through informational pamphlets/leaflets and sit through meetings to find the information they're looking for. Digital technology can alleviate these stressors by allowing users to quickly find streamlined information in one place from the comfort of their own space. 

## Step02: Target users 

The target users for this project are adults, between the ages of 25-35, that are interested in wildlife conservation and envrionmental justice. The average user should have some knowledge about wildlife conservation and biodiversity, but does not necessarily have to be an expert. These users would be seeking out information for their own personal, career, or academic endeavors, such as working on their own project about wildlife conservation or for a company, organization, or university. To complete their search, they may contact non-profits geared toward wildlife conservation, research a library's database, or reference different sites containing information about wildlife conservation. Their search would likely occur out in the field (e.g., visting organzation's offices or attedning events), or a personal or public space such as an office or library. To search for information online using a database or search engine would addtionally require internet connection.


## Step03: Research methods 
The observation method I selected was participatory observation. I had several activities with my interviewee to explore the issue and their potential interest as well as their reactions to the topic.

## Insights from the Interview 

- How interested are you in engaging with organizations online through educational material versus in person activism?
*> I'd say like, prefer, like, in person activism, just because, like, you know, it's face to face and you see, you know, the impact but like, you know, we're getting in like, these days, this day and age, like, everything's online. So like, I think we're just gonna have to like, you know, move with the times. And yeah, Then like obviously you can like reach like farther with like internet you know you can reach farther like to more people so like it's always something to like I guess become savvy in
