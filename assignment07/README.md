# Assignment 7: High-Fidelity Prototype

Giovanni Anguiano | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Overview

### Summary

This prototype is a redesign of the WWF Together app. This prototype aims to have easy and intuitive navigation to make it simpler for users to use and enjoy. This prototpye features two features that the current app's design lacks: volunteer and networking opportunites and links to donation.

### Process

This high-fidelity, interactive prototype was created based on several steps throughout the design process. First, the interactions included in this prototype were chosen based on observations made during usability testing and contextual analysis. Next, two user personas were created and assigned to a specific interaction, based on how much benefit it could bring to them related to their personal circumstances. Then, wireframes and wireflows were created as part of a low-fidelity prototype, which was tested with one user. Feedback from user informed changes made to the tentative design for certain interactions. These changes were then incorporated into into the high-fidelity, interactive prototype that was made using Figma.

### Purpose

The purpose of creating this high-fidelity prototype is to visualize the functional and UX/UI-related improvements that I would like to implement to WWF Together app. These functional and UX/UI-related improvements place great focus on easy navigation, something the app currently struggles with.

### Tasks

- Find a nearby networking event from the Volunteer and Networking opportunities tab using the advanced filter.
- Find causes to donate to and successfully donate to one organization

## Cognitive Walkthrough

The cognitive walkthrough went smoothly and thankfully helped me identify some small areas of improvement. My two testers were able to successfully complete the given tasks and followed the intended flow of interactions. They enjoyed the clear user feedback given to them and liked how clean and sleek the interface is. Here are some highlights from their constructive notes:

1. Some boxes look like buttons instead of drop downs, which causes confusion for navigations
> Proposed Revision: Have the boxes turn into a simple underlining and keep the drop down arrow

2. The text is a bit small
> Proposed Revision: Increase the text size from 11pt to 14pt

3. The GPS feature automatically takes location without giving extra confirmation
> Proposed Revision: Have a lock-in constraint when users attempt to utilize GPS feature. Lock-in will ask when the app can track location (e.g., allow once, allow while using app)

4. The home screen is pretty confusing
> Proposed Revision: Change the home screen to display all animals instead of just one

## Usability Test

In addition to the cognitive walkthrough, I conducted a usability test with a participant to find any other issues with the prototype.

The usability test went well, despite some technical issues. The particpant found the design to be simple and intuitive, asserting that the features were well-integrated. They appreciated how they can always find everything they need in the menu bar, making navigation very easy. All of the tasks performed in this UT were completed quickly and pretty efficiently. The participant stated that even when some things were confusing, they were able to figure out a solution pretty fast. They descrbied the app as calm, creative, fresh, professional, and trustworthy. Some of the issues they noted/things they wish were present on the prototype were indeed present, but figma was not properly loading all of the prototype's elements, such as pop-out overlays. Nevertheless, this usability test, reaffirmed issues that were noted in the cognitive walkthrough, demonstrating the important need for such features. Based on the participants comments, the following changes were made:

## General Changes

1. I changed the the home screen to include all animals instead of just one. This was noted during the cognitive walkthrough. Users were confused on what it was for and didn't know what to do with it. In the original design, the screen displays one animal and users nust swipe to see more. In this revision, all animals are displayed and users can scroll vertically to see others. 

2. The edges of the boxes for the animals on the homescreen were changed from a rounded 15px to a squared 0. The participant in the UT noted that it would be better this way to maintain consistency

## Problem Specific

1. Back buttons vs Home/Navigation bar
> Problem: Didn't like having to hit multiple buttons to get back to navigation bar
> Solution: Replaced back arrows with navigation bar for all necessary pages to reduce back and forth (wasn't included in pages like confirmation or sign up page)

2. More clear feedback
> Problem: Some features didn't give clear feedback so user wasn't sure if their commands went through (ex. changing event type on advanced filter)
> Solution: Overlays and transitions were fixed on the prototype to make feedback more clear for users
