# Redesigning WWF Together

## Giovanni Anguiano | DH110 UX+UI Design | Fall 2022

### Introduction

Although the environment can continue to survive in its natural state, human intervention has caused extensive destruction in many ecosystems. It is very important for us to protect our environment, so that we can continue to live on this planet - in a healthy and safe atmosphere. Healthy ecosystems clean our water, purify our air, maintain our soil, regulate the climate, recycle nutrients and provide us with food. They provide raw materials and resources for medicines and other purposes. They are at the foundation of all civilisation and sustain our economies. WWF Together is an app that seeks to promote these ideas, giving special focus on wildlife conservation. The app does a great job informing audiences about endangered species, but doesn't go beyond that. Therefore, this project is meant to support users in finding ways to engage with and get involved in wildlife conservation.

### Design Statement

The purpose of this project is to improve the WWF Together app by allowing users to not just learn about wildlife conservation, but have resources to get involved in different mediums. Additionally, a big issue with the app is how difficult it is to navigate. By making changes to the design and implementing new features, I want to allow users have an easygoing experience as they find opportunities to get involved. Therefore, the main question at hand is: In what ways can change the WWF Together to make it a more explorative and rewarding experience that is both enjoyable and easy for users?

### Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation

A heuristic evaluation was conducted on the WWF Togther with one user to have a more clear understanding of the existing UX-related issues with the app. The evaluation demonstrated that while it thrived in “Aesthetic and Minimalist design”, the navigation was very complex and unintuitive for users making them frustrated, so it did poorly in "Recogniton rather than recall".

### Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing

Usability testing, an essential part of the user-centered design process, allows designers to determine how easy or difficult interfaces are to use. Through user feedback, changes in the design can be made, which ultimately improve the product’s efficiency and satisfaction. In my pilot UT, it was found that much of the interface lacked clear affordances and signifiers, making it harder for users to perform their tasks and led them to be frustrated.

### User Research

A contextual inquiry was conducted to understand what features users were seeking and what would make it easier for them to use the app. Through a participatory observation, I found that users were looking for more opportunities to get involved in biodiversity conservation. They did not just want to learn, they wanted to take action, but did not know where to start. [...read more](https://github.com/giovannianguiano1/DH110-F22-Gio/tree/main/assignment03)

### UX Storytelling

The objective of UX storytelling is to step out of your own perspective and into user’s perspective. Creating personas and along with a story allows design teams to empathize with the target users. After conducting research, I had a more clear idea of my target users so I created two personas to step into the shoes of my audience and better understand their motivations and desires. Find the full personas [here](https://github.com/giovannianguiano1/DH110-F22-Gio/tree/main/assignment04).

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation 

Taking the perspective of my personas led me to incorporate three different features into my redesign of the WWF Together app, I wanted to give users a: 

* Filter function
* Volunteer and Networking Opportunities tab
* Sharing Function

With these features in mind, I took to translating them into tangible screen designs. The app already has a very sleek and minimalist design, so I wanted to maintain that. [...read more](https://github.com/giovannianguiano1/DH110-F22-Gio/tree/main/assignment05)


### Low-Fidelity Prototype

Before going into the high-fidelity prototyping, I create sketches of the screens along with user flows. Through these low-fidelity prototypes, it enabled me to determine whether users could understand the app’s flow. Based on the user personas and scenarios, I created three tasks to test with a participant: 

1. Find a networking opportunity nearby using the advanced filter and plan to attend to an event
2. Go to the photos section and share a photo of an animal to a friend
3. Do a quick search about elephants and find a cause supporting them to donate to

### High-Fidelity Prototype

Based on the low-fidelity prototype, I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. This helped me bring my project to life and envision what the end product might look like providing a concrete visualization that could be tested with users. By alternating between designing screens and testing with users, I could iterate towards a better user experience.

### Evaluation and Revision History

I conducted a cognitive walkthrough along with an impression test with two users to identify any apparent issues. Following their observations, I conducted a usability test detect any further issues. The usability test was conducted over Zoom and the participants expressions and comments were captured. Following this usability test, I arrived at a final design.

### Conclusion

Overall, I believe I met my goal of redesigning the WWF Together app in such a way that allows user to become more involved while maintaining an intuitive design, therefore giving users a more fulfilling experience. I implemented features that met the needs of users based on the contextual inquiry and personas. Through my usability testing, I got to experience the iterative design process for the first time. I learned a lot of useful information that will definitely help me become a better UX Researcher.

When I first started this project, I felt very intimidated because I felt like the WWF Together was already great in its design so I wouldn’t have much to contribute. But then I realized I could just expand the app to be even better by implementing features that make users feel more involved. Thus, my project built upon the existing elements of the WWF Together. The next time I attempt my own project, I would like to come up with a whole new app and do more extensive research.
